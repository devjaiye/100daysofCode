//..Now, with ES6, there are three ways of defining your
// variables: var, let, and const.

/*
var 
•	If you use var outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope.
•	If you use var inside of a function, it belongs to that function.
•	If you use var inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is still available outside of that block.
•	var has a function scope, not a block scope.
let
•	let is the block scoped version of var, and is limited to the block (or expression) where it is defined.
•	If you use let inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is only available inside of that loop.
•	let has a block scope.
const
•	const is a variable that once it has been created, its value can never change.
•	const has a block scope.
•	It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value… For example, you can change the element of a constant array or the properties of a constant object. 
You can NOT:
•	Reassign a constant value
•	Reassign a constant array
•	Reassign a constant object
